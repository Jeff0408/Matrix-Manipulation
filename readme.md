This project is to write c++ library for client to do MxN matrices multiply and transpose.
This project is wrote bu C++11.

There are four file inside: matrix.hpp, matrix.cpp, main.cpp, makefile.
You can compile it in Linux by the command:
$ make
or:
$ g++ main.cpp matrix.cpp

And then you will get main.o, matrix.o, matrix.out

To run to program:
for multiply
$ ./matrix.out multiply
And then input your two matrices, you will get your result of multiply.

for transpose
$ ./matrix.out transpose
And then input your matrix, you will get your result of transpose.
